Hook is installed as .git/hooks/pre-merge-commit and can be skipped via SKIP_PRE_MERGE_UPSTREAM environment variable. Documentation added to CONTRIBUTING.md. The hook ensures the fork stays updated with upstream when merging into the main branch, preventing accidental merges with outdated upstream.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-18T10:38:41.505792-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T12:29:26.996024-07:00","closed_at":"2025-12-18T12:29:26.996024-07:00","close_reason":"Implemented pre-merge-upstream hook script and documentation"}
